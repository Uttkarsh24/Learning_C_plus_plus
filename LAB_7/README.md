# Lab-Exercise 7

## Questions

1. Consider an example of declaring the examination result. Design three classes: Student,
Exam, and Result. The Student class has data members representing roll number, name.
Create the class Exam by inheriting Student class. The Exam class adds fields (data
members) representing the marks scored in six subjects. Derive the Result from the Exam
class, and it has its own fields such as total_marks. Write an interactive program to model
this relationship.

2. There is a class student, that stores name of school or university from which he is
enrolled and name of highest degree he has obtained so far. It has the function to get and
display the members. Design a class Employee with name and employee number. Derive
Manager, Scientist and Laborer classes from Employee class. The manager class has
extra attribute title (string type) and dues (float type). The scientist class has extra
attributes number of publications. The Laborer class has nothing extra. The classes have
necessary functions for set and display the information. The manager and scientist are
students of a university also. Use inheritance. Test your program by creating objects of
type manager, scientists and laborer.

3. Write a program with a mother class and a derived daughter class. Both of them should
have a method void display () that prints a message (different for mother and daughter).In
the main function declare an object of class daughter and call the display() method on it.
Also suitably invoke the display() function of mother class using this object of class
daughter.

4. An educational institution wishes to maintain a database of its employees. The database is
divided into a number of classes whose hierarchical relationships are shown in Fig.1. The
figure also shows the minimum information required for each class. Specify all the
classes and define members functions for reading and printing the data. Write main
function by declaring the objects of teacher, regular, casual, officer classes.
