# LAB EXERCISE 2

## Questions:-

1. Write a function that finds the minimum and the maximum value in an array of N
   integers. Inputs to the function are the array of integers, an integer variable containing
   the length of the array and pointers to integer variables that will contain the minimum
   and the maximum values. The function prototype is:
   void minmax( int array[], int length, int * min, int * max);
   Write a main function that uses this function to find and display the minimum and the 
   maximum values of an array of integers.  
2. Write a function to reverse an array of long double types. Call this function from main
   function. Use the concept of dynamic memory allocation for creating the array. Also,
   deallocate the memory suitably.
3. Write a program to compare two strings using pointer. Do not use strcmp() library
   function.
4. Write a program to perform the addition of two matrices using function.
5. Write a program to perform the addition of two complex numbers using structures.
