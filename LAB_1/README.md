# LAB EXERCISE 1

## Questions:-

1. Write a program to calculate factorial of a number N using recursion.
2. Write a program to print “Hello JUET !” without main() function.
3. Write a program to print "Hello JUET !" without using any semicolon.
4. Write a program using a function which returns 1 if A[i]=i otherwise it returns 0. Here A
   is a 1-D array.
5. Write a program to round off an integer “i” to the next largest multiple of another integer
   "j”. Take the values of i and j from user. For example, if i=256 and j=7 then you will get
   259.
6. Write a program which finds a four digit number AABB which is a perfect square. A and
   B represent different digits. For example 7744 is a four digit perfect square number which
   is also satisfying the condition AABB ie. first two digits (AA=77) are same and last two
   digits (BB=44) are same.
7. Write a function which takes a string as input from user and returns the length of that
   string without using any string library functions. Call this function from main function. 
8. Write a function strcat(s,t) which concatenates the string t to the end of string s.
   Call this function from main function.
9. Given an array A of size N-1 and given that there are numbers from 1 to N with one
   element missing; Write program to find the missing number.
   Test case 1: Given array: 1 2 3 5; missing element is 4.
10. Write the function strend(s,t), which returns 1 if the string t occurs at the end of the
    string s, and zero otherwise.
    Sample Test case1:
    Input:
    s=”Object Oriented Programming using C++”
    t=”Using C++”
    Output: 1
    Sample Test case2:
    Input:
    s=”Object Oriented Programming using C++”
    t=”Programming”
    Output: 0
